## My process

- Build out mark-up 
- Set custom properties and apply reset 
- Build mobile view 
- Adjust for 1440px 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This was my first time applying custom properties, they were useful but I could do with a lot more practise to apply them in cases other than color.
- First time using grid for a complex layout, frustrating but I will feel more confident going into my next project.

### Continued development

- More practise with grid 
- Need to understand how to get images to scale better 
- Need to get better at applying unniversal styling - I was putting out little fires in individual cards which when resolved would often break something out, it made me think there has to be a better way.
